<p> 
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages, controlling elements like color, font, and spacing. It allows for responsive design, ensuring websites look good on various devices. By linking CSS to HTML, you can separate content from design, making it easier to maintain and update.

    <p> CSS Basics involve selectors, properties, and values to apply styles to HTML elements. Key concepts include the box model, which defines how elements are sized and spaced, and Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts. Additionally, CSS variables enable reusable values, enhancing maintainability and creativity in design.
